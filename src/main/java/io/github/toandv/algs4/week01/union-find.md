# Quadratic algorithms do not scale with technology

Computers get faster and memories get bigger, that means the problem size get bigger.
If computers get faster 10 times and memories get bigger 10 time so the size of problem get bigger 10 times.
So the quadratic algorithms get slower 10 times (10^2 = 100)
